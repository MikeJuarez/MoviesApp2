# Movies App (Nanodegree Project #1)

In this project, I will create an app that displays popular and top-rated movies from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">THE MOVIE DB</a>'s database.  The app demonstrates my ability to use Intents, Content Provider, JSON data retrieval, RecyclerViews and much more.  Read below for the tasks that I was able to complete.

You値l add more information to your movie details view:

You値l allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
You値l allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
You値l also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
You'll create a database and content provider to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
You値l modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
Recall from Stage 1, you built a UI that presented the user with a grid of movie posters, allowed users to change sort order, and presented a screen with additional information on the movie selected by the user:
